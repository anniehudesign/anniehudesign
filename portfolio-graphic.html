			<h3>Paul Rand Book</h3>
				<p>The objective of this project was to create a book based on text from
					Paul Rand's &quot;Design &amp; the Play Instinct&quot; discussion. The idea
					of this particular book was based off of the idea of &quot;playing within the rules&quot;,
					a reoccurring theme throughout Paul Rand's discussion. A lighter shade of red and blue were
					used to create a more toned down yet playful atmosphere, and the book cover was created
					to resemble that of a box, showing that the book itself is playing within the &quot;rules&quot;. </p>

			<h3>UMFF Event Poster</h3>
			<p> The goal of this project was to create an event schedule poster for the 2017 Universe
				Multicultural Film Festival held from March 31rd to April 2nd. To convey the nature of the
				festival, different shades of skin color were incorporated in the title of the poster. To
				represent diversity, colors of the rainbow were used for each individual event, which also
				serves to help distinguish the events at the same time. The center icon combines the idea of
				film and universe. This poster was made in a minimalistic to allow the audience to be able
				see the poster and read the information easily. </p>

			<h3>Type Hierarchy</h3>
			<p> The main objective of this projcet was to create a series of 10in.x 10in. flyers for a lecture series
			with a focus on type hierarchy. Certain rules were to be followed in each of the flyers. To depict the title
			as the largest, a larger font towards the top left appeared to be the most successful. The events were then grouped individual
			to distinguish from one another. The words were put playfully to show the potentials of type, while keeping the contents
			legible at the same time.</p>

			<h3>Typeface Poster</h3>
			<p> This project aimed to excercise Illustrator and research skills while increasing the understanding of
				typefaces by creating a poster for a well-known font. This particular poster displayed Weiss, a German typeface
				used in past German textbooks. The most distinctive letter of Weiss is the letter W, which was placed as the
				main attraction of the poster. In addition, the poster was created to be similar to a book page to demonstrate
				its past uses. Yellowing of the poster and the colors red and black were also used to add resemblance to its past uses.</p>

			<h3>Design Career Fair 2017</h3>
			<p> The Design Career Fair (DCF) is an annual design event where design students are able to speak to potential employers for
			future career opportunities. Each year, a different theme is chosen to represent the idea of design through the eyes of the students.
		  Below are ideations that took place in order to execute this year's theme, "Playground", from start to finish. </p>

			<p>This was a recoloring of the DCF logo, which utilized colors chosen by members of Design Careers Club, consisted of playful hues of
			blue, yellow, green, and red. The idea of gradients blends the colors together as a playful take on the teamwork involved in design. The colors
		  were tested against both a dark and light background to provide versatility in different promotional materials.</p>

			<p>After the theme of the fair was decided to be "Playground", brainstorms on a variety of promotional materials were assigned to members of
			Design Careers Club. Two of the assigned tasks were place cards for companies and geofilters for the duration of the event.The place cards were
		  meant to include both the companies' names as well as whether or not they are available. The Snapchat geofilters utilized the color palette chosen for the fair and
		  incorporated several elements of design and the fair's theme, playground. </p>
